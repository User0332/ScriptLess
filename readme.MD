# ScriptLess

A library for executing JavaScript "from the server side"

NOTE: This library is not fully functional and is a work in progress.

This project works side-by-side with Flask. You can execute code like `window.location.href = '/'` in your Flask app or even create a function in your server side code that you want to run in the client side.
